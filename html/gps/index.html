			<ul>Purpose of semantic tags: provides extra details and labeling for quicker search finds, as well as helps visually impaired people navigate the web.</ul>
			<ul>What is the order the browser uses?  I'm a little unclear of what exactly the question is asking but I'd say it goes left to right, top to bottom using the html snippet:
				<!--<!DOCTYPE html>
				#<html>
				#<head>
				#	<title></title>
				#</head>
				#<body>
				
				#</body>
				#</html>-->
			<ul> What I learned about Sublime: if you're finding yourself typing long pieces of code frequently, its quite easy to set up a snippet for a shortcut.  I will definitely be utilizing snippets in the very near future.</ul>
			<ul>Making good-looking tables is still a struggle for me, but I'm going to do some extra practice on my own making more tables to try and feel my way around them.</ul>
